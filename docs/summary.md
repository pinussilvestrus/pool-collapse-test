### Test 1 - Ingo Richtsmeier (2nd December)

* knows about elements will deleted afterwards --> wanted to save the process contents in another diagram
* was on to re-model the message flows because he knows they will be gone
* wishes a way to persist the process content (cf. [#509 (comment)](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler/issues/509#issuecomment-349950871))
* would prefer to save in diagram (e.g. via extension element), and not in a seperate file
* back to variant A: it's very misleading that it's preventing him to proceed
* switch to B1: likes it much more, less clicks !
* would have expect a reformat of the message flows ([#1651](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler/issues/1651))
* he was confused by the term "Black Box"
* he understands it after some explanation from the BPMN 2.0 specification
* he really appreciated the "removes content" hint !
* maybe "contend deleted"
* B2: prefers "Empty Pool" over "Black Box Pool"
* Would stay with "Collapsed Pool" because he was getting used to it
* Empty Pool would be okay, but they would have to change training material
* If pool has no content, the "removes content" hint is not needed
* Basically this would be an improvement, but still prefers are more advanced feature in saving the contents
